# Houseprice-prediction
📌 About the Project This project focuses on predicting house prices using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can estimate the price of a house based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.

This project applies exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning models like Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting to accurately predict house prices.
